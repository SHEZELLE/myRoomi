            <p><h4>Bio/Description:</h4>
                Hello! I'm Sophia, a friendly and outgoing individual with a passion for adventure and creativity. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in graphic design and work part-time as a freelance illustrator. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the city's art scene, going on hikes, and trying out new coffee shops. I'm a considerate roommate who values open communication and creating a warm and welcoming living space.</p>

                Occupation: None <br>
                Education: 1st Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design (in progress) from The University of Johannesburg</p>
            <p><h4>Interests and Hobbies:</h4> 
                I'm a creative soul who loves all things art-related. I enjoy painting, sketching, and visiting art exhibitions. I'm also a foodie and love exploring different cuisines and experimenting in the kitchen. In my downtime, I like reading fantasy novels and listening to indie music.</p>
            <p><h4>Preferences and Compatibility:</h4> 
                Ideal Roommate Traits: I'm looking for a roommate who is respectful, easygoing, and enjoys occasional socializing. It would be great to live with someone who shares an appreciation for art and enjoys exploring the city's cultural events.</p>
            <p><h4>Compatibility Factors:</h4> 
                 I have a cat and prefer a smoke-free environment. I'm quite messy especially with my artworks. I like it like that although I appreciate roommates who contribute to household chores. I'm open to hosting occasional small gatherings or movie nights with friends.</p>
